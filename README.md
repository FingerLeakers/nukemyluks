# Nuke My LUKS
A simple network-based panic button designed to overwrite the LUKS header
with random data and reboot the computer in case of an emergency situation.

This tool can be useful for activists, human right workers and others that
face an adversary, such as law enforcement, that can force the subject to
disclose the encryption passwords for the computer's hard drives.

**IMPORTANT**: This will make **impossible** to recover any data stored in the disk even if the password is known. It is recommended to store your backups
encrypted and in a safe location. **Use this code with precaution.**
